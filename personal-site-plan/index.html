        Brainstorming / Preface 
<br>
The Rules that will make this system unique to other RPG systems is the emphasis on encounters being quick and easy while allowing for complex and intricate game play for both players and the Opposition. Aspects that will make this game unique are as follows:  

Making use of alternating activations and having a wargame like feel for all encounter types. The Gm has been renamed to Opposition. The purpose behind the rename is to help inexperienced players understand that in this RPG the main purpose of the Opposition is to defeat the players using the encounter success or failure mechanic (That is another feature that will be talked about.) The Opposition should stick to the rules as closely as possible but making sure to make leeway for realistic and reasonable actions not covered by the base rules of the game. Do keep in mind that the Opposition’s job is not specifically to kill or remove PCs from play. The use of specific enemy types such as Artillery, Battlefield Controller, Soldier, Skirmisher, Vanguard, and Warlord. With the enhancements of Hero and Villain.A direct correlation between enemy abilities and player abilities for streamlined customization of abilities and allows for enhanced player understanding of monsters and allowing for the opposition to plan balanced fights. There are a series of encounter types: Adventure, Combat, Social, and mixed encounters. The die system will use each dice with the basic set of seven. With a focus on d6’s.
