    Alternating Activations 

In an alternate activation system, The Opposition and the Party take turns activating individual Characters or Squads under their control. 
<br>
For example: 

Initial Party activates a Character or Squad (moves, shoots, uses abilities, charges, or fights). 

The Secondary Party then activates one of their Characters or Squads. 

This back-and-forth continues until all Entities have acted. 

Initial Activation is determined by a Parties total initiative score. 

If a Party has an Initiative score that is ten or more than the other Party an ambush is initiated.  

The Party that initiates an ambush may activate every character or Squad they control before the other Party may activate an Entity. Once the ambush is completed, you will determine initial activations as normal.  

How a Turn functions 

During an encounter an Entity has the following actions they can take in a turn in any order.  
<br>
Movement 
<br>
Action 
<br>
Minor action 
<br>
Movement can be spent to grant a Character a minor action, an action can be turned into a minor action, if you spend your minor action and movement, you may take a second action (All rolls made during a second action taken during a turn are made with a –1)  
<br>
Attacking 

When attacking the target of your attack makes a number of dodge rolls equal to your weapon’s attack value. This determines how many attacks you get to make against the target's armor. Each roll beating the opponent's armor deals damage 
<br>
Entity Types 

Every Entity has a type that determines how it will interact with the Character during an encounter.  
<br>
Allied NPCs 

Allies are NPCs friendly to the Character. Allied NPCs are controlled by the Character during an encounter. 

Artillery 

Artillery Entities represent mass arrow barrages, catapults, meteor, etc. Artillery Entities have long range, area effects, and deal a lot of damage. They are typically physically weak and easy to take down once proximity is reached. Artillery do not typically have high movement speed and rely on distance as their defense. 
<br>
Battlefield Controller 

A battlefield controller is an Entity that controls the environment of an encounter. Battlefield controllers will hamper opponents' movement, line of sight, and abilities. This type of Entity typically is physically weak, relying on their abilities, and allies to fight opponents and defend them. Overall battlefield controllers have low damage and are supportive in an encounter.  
<br>
Soldier 

This type of Entity is very average on all fronts. This type of Entity is typically part of a frontline protecting the supportive Entities in the rear. Typically, more defensive than anything else this Entity can put up a fight against PC’s. 
<br>
Skirmisher 

Skirmishers rely on speed and dodge rolls. Rushing across the battlefield, these entities will hit and run repeatedly until they defeat their opponent. Typically, Skirmishers are armed with ranged weapons or attacking multiple targets in quick succession 
<br>
Underling 

Underlings are nothing more than chaff to get in the way of PCs, but PCs beware, large numbers of Underlings have spelled the doom of many an adventurer. Underlings do not have health; instead, they die the moment they would take damage. 
<br>
Vanguard 

The vanguard is the center piece of any Opposition force. Dealing massive amounts of damage and having a monstrous health pool the vanguard is a terrifying and brutal force for PCs to deal with 
<br>
Warlord 

Warlords command Opposition forces, grant allies' great boons, and allow for Opposition forces to act during the warlord’s activation. 
<br>
Hero/Villan 

Heroes and Villans are NPCs that increase their skills like PCs. These NPCs are meant to interact with the party multiple times throughout a story. Heroes are Allied NPCs that Increase their skills exactly how players increase their skills. Villans are a little more complicated.
