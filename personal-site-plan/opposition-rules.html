    Mortal Kingdoms 

        Arnorian coorperative: Pirates, cannons, and big ships. 

        A loose council of the most influential merchants and ship captains who rule through the might of the Arnorian leviathans. These supermassive floating structures are warships that can raze coastal cities in no time. Arnorian marines are brutal pirates and masterful swordsman. In Arnoria money is king, most of the peacekeepers in the city have been bought out by various families and they will ignore what they are told to ignore. Slavery is huge within the kingdom though other kingdoms despise slavery such as the Theocracy they let it slide because Arnoria controls most of the river trade routes and Arnoria threatens these nations with economic sanctions which would lead to large monetary hits that would economically cripple those nations for years to come. Main exports are Slaves, exotic herbs, exotic animals, drugs, and the largest banks in Azerrus. 

        Raltan Empire: Knights, footmen, and peasants. 

        This monarchy has maintained pure nobility for the last 500+ years since the first king was crowned. Those of noble blood are the cultural elite. To not bow to a noble is a crime. The rich who are not nobles such as industrialists and merchants fight a silent war against the nobility with economics and political maneuvering. The noble class keeps the rich members of the kingdom happy while maintaining military control and flaunting it to put down the occasional uppity merchant who lets their ego get the better of them. This kingdom boasts its heavy calvary and elite soldiers, its main exports are food products and metal.  

        Essen Triumvirate: Assassins, snipers, and witch hunters.  

        Nestled in the valley of the Stranger. The Triumvirate is led by the three highest ranking members of the Dark Cloaks. The Dark Cloaks are not only the military and the government, but they are also the best spies in the land. Entrance into their valley is rare and they only let you into certain parts of their cities. These militant police state has done everything it can to maintain a fearsome reputation. Their main exports are selling the services of Dark Cloaks which entails mercenary work, assassins, and investigators, the extremely rare mithril of the World Wall, and lumber. 

        Loth-cor Theocracy: Clerics, paladins, and priests 

        This kingdom takes pride in the worship of the Heralds and the Great creators. This kingdom avidly sends missionaries to preach to the other kingdoms. The government structure is a council of 101 high priests. Iron hands are the loose military of  Lothâ€™cor and are known as renowned heroes and warriors. Membership speaks volumes of an individual's character and moral fiber making them trusted bodyguards with the underlining understanding that their loyalty is to the theocracy first and can must respond to a summons when the horns of war are sounded. Some say that the greatest of the priests and warriors of the Creators have been able to perform great miracles, such as healing the sick, accurately seeing the future, and most notably in recent history the high priest is rumored to have summoned a heavenly blade of fire to strike down an assassin. Notable exports are medicines, textiles, and the Iron Hand directly competes with the Dark Cloak mercenaries.
