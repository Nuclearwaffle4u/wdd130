    <p>
        Players interact with the story through their characters, also known as a PC.  PCs have the following stats. 
        <br>
        Body: Your Resilience total is your HP total and resisting abilities. 
        <br>
        Will: Resisting abilities, fear, and final stand 
        <br>
        Mind: Correlates to using abilities, contesting abilities 
        <br>
        Agility: Correlates to attack speed, movement, and dodge 
        <br>
        Character: Leadership and communication 
        <br>
        Your character sheet's calculations are based on combinations of the previously stated abilities.  
        <br>
        Movement is how many spaces you can move on a hex/square grid. During character creation you start with 6 stat points. Each stat point is used to increase your stats as shown in the table
        Attacks and damage are determined by weapons. 
        <br>
        Movement: Number of spaces you can move 
        <br>
        Health: Number of damage points you can take before you are killed. 0 Health = Death. 
        <br>
        Absorption: The roll for the enemy to beat in order to damage you with magical attacks. 
        <br>
        Armor: The roll the enemy must beat to damage you with physical attacks. 
        <br>
        Dodge: The save roll for you to avoid any ranged attack. 
        <br>
        Resistance: A number of rolls made by a PC equal to the amount of damage taken, each successful roll negates a single point of damage taken. Must roll equal to or higher than your resistance rating which starts at a 7 base. 
        <br>
        Training 

        Training gives you access to potent skills and allows you to know magic. You cannot attempt to make a check involving magic if you are not trained. 
        <br>
        Magic types 
        <br>
        Creation: Elemental, creation, gravity, manipulation of the world. 
        <br>
        Void: Destruction, unmaking, anti-magic, and teleportation. 
        <br>
        Balance: Mastery of the body, destruction, creation, elemental effects. (All abilities must target self) 
        <br>
        Arcane: The easiest types of spells to cast but they require intense study, dictated by the laws of magic arcane spells are complex and reliable. With long casting times arcane magic can do anything the other magic can without miscasting chance. 
        <br>
        Magic Rules 
        <br>
        All magic types require a minimum of 12 to pass the casting requirement. Your skill in that magic type reduces the requirement by your magic bonus. If your creation magic stat is a 5 then you would subtract 12 by 5.  
        <br>
        Miscasting 
        <br>
        On an unsuccessful roll of three or more, for example if you roll a 9 on a 12 check you take 1d3 damage (this damage is unreducible). 
        <br>
        On an unsuccessful roll of 6 or more, for example rolling a 6 on a 12 check you take 1d6 damage (this damage is unreducible). 
        <br>
        On an unsuccessful check of 9 or more, for example rolling a 3 on a 12 check you take 2d6 damage (this damage is unreducible). 
        <br>
        If you roll snake eyes or double ones on your 2d6 casting dice, you successfully cast the spell centered on you. Healing now does damage, effects that would target only enemies or only allies now affect all characters in range, and up to opposition discretion the effects of the spell now do the most harm that the spell is capable of as you lose control of your magic. 
        <br>
        Conjuring spells increase the difficulty of the spell by +1 for every 3 power the target of the conjuring is worth.  
        <br>
        Combat 

        Initiative order. 

        Take your turn and perform available actions. 

        When using your action to attack, you attack a number of times equal to equipped weapon profiles. If the weapon profile has different damage and attack values roll them separately from each other. Roll d6â€™s to attack an enemy and apply bonuses if your roll is greater than the armor of the target that is a successful hit. 

        Before making a ranged attack tell the target of the attack the attack value of the ranged weapon. The target if able makes an equal number of dodge rolls. For each successful dodge roll subtract from the number of ranged attacks you get to roll. (Some abilities allow for a target to dodge melee attacks as well)
