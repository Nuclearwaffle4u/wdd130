        What makes Mortal Realms unique?  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <h4>
      The Rules that will make this system unique to other RPG systems is the emphasis on encounters being quick and easy while allowing for complex and intricate game play for both players and the Opposition. Aspects that will make this game unique are as follows:  
      Making use of alternating activations and having a wargame like feel for all encounter types. The Gm has been renamed to Opposition. The purpose behind the rename is to help inexperienced players understand that in this RPG the main purpose of the Opposition is to defeat the players using the encounter success or failure mechanic (That is another feature that will be talked about.) The Opposition should stick to the rules as closely as possible but making sure to make leeway for realistic and reasonable actions not covered by the base rules of the game. Do keep in mind that the Opposition’s job is not specifically to kill or remove PCs from play. The use of specific enemy types such as Artillery, Battlefield Controller, Soldier, Skirmisher, Vanguard, and Warlord. With the enhancements of Hero and Villain.A direct correlation between enemy abilities and player abilities for streamlined customization of abilities and allows for enhanced player understanding of monsters and allowing for the opposition to plan balanced fights. There are a series of encounter types: Adventure, Combat, Social, and mixed encounters. The die system will use each dice with the basic set of seven. With a focus on d6’s.  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Character Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Players interact with the story through their characters, also known as a PC.  PCs have the following stats. 

        Body: Your Resilience total is your HP total and resisting abilities. 

        Will: Resisting abilities, fear, and final stand 

        Mind: Correlates to using abilities, contesting abilities 

        Agility: Correlates to attack speed, movement, and dodge 

        Character: Leadership and communication 

        Your character sheet's calculations are based on combinations of the previously stated abilities.  

        Movement is how many spaces you can move on a hex/square grid. During character creation you start with 6 stat points. Each stat point is used to increase your stats as shown in the table
        Attacks and damage are determined by weapons. 

        Movement: Number of spaces you can move 

        Health: Number of damage points you can take before you are killed. 0 Health = Death. 

        Absorption: The roll for the enemy to beat in order to damage you with magical attacks. 

        Armor: The roll the enemy must beat to damage you with physical attacks. 

        Dodge: The save roll for you to avoid any ranged attack. 

        Resistance: A number of rolls made by a PC equal to the amount of damage taken, each successful roll negates a single point of damage taken. Must roll equal to or higher than your resistance rating which starts at a 7 base. 

        Training 

        Training gives you access to potent skills and allows you to know magic. You cannot attempt to make a check involving magic if you are not trained. 

        Magic types 

        Creation: Elemental, creation, gravity, manipulation of the world. 

        Void: Destruction, unmaking, anti-magic, and teleportation. 

        Balance: Mastery of the body, destruction, creation, elemental effects. (All abilities must target self) 

        Arcane: The easiest types of spells to cast but they require intense study, dictated by the laws of magic arcane spells are complex and reliable. With long casting times arcane magic can do anything the other magic can without miscasting chance. 

        Magic Rules 

        All magic types require a minimum of 12 to pass the casting requirement. Your skill in that magic type reduces the requirement by your magic bonus. If your creation magic stat is a 5 then you would subtract 12 by 5.  

        Miscasting 

        On an unsuccessful roll of three or more, for example if you roll a 9 on a 12 check you take 1d3 damage (this damage is unreducible). 

        On an unsuccessful roll of 6 or more, for example rolling a 6 on a 12 check you take 1d6 damage (this damage is unreducible). 

        On an unsuccessful check of 9 or more, for example rolling a 3 on a 12 check you take 2d6 damage (this damage is unreducible). 

        If you roll snake eyes or double ones on your 2d6 casting dice, you successfully cast the spell centered on you. Healing now does damage, effects that would target only enemies or only allies now affect all characters in range, and up to opposition discretion the effects of the spell now do the most harm that the spell is capable of as you lose control of your magic. 

        Conjuring spells increase the difficulty of the spell by +1 for every 3 power the target of the conjuring is worth.  

        Combat 

        Initiative order. 

        Take your turn and perform available actions. 

        When using your action to attack, you attack a number of times equal to equipped weapon profiles. If the weapon profile has different damage and attack values roll them separately from each other. Roll d6’s to attack an enemy and apply bonuses if your roll is greater than the armor of the target that is a successful hit. 

        Before making a ranged attack tell the target of the attack the attack value of the ranged weapon. The target if able makes an equal number of dodge rolls. For each successful dodge roll subtract from the number of ranged attacks you get to roll. (Some abilities allow for a target to dodge melee attacks as well)

      <h3>Opposition Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Mortal Kingdoms 

        Arnorian coorperative: Pirates, cannons, and big ships. 

        A loose council of the most influential merchants and ship captains who rule through the might of the Arnorian leviathans. These supermassive floating structures are warships that can raze coastal cities in no time. Arnorian marines are brutal pirates and masterful swordsman. In Arnoria money is king, most of the peacekeepers in the city have been bought out by various families and they will ignore what they are told to ignore. Slavery is huge within the kingdom though other kingdoms despise slavery such as the Theocracy they let it slide because Arnoria controls most of the river trade routes and Arnoria threatens these nations with economic sanctions which would lead to large monetary hits that would economically cripple those nations for years to come. Main exports are Slaves, exotic herbs, exotic animals, drugs, and the largest banks in Azerrus. 

        Raltan Empire: Knights, footmen, and peasants. 

        This monarchy has maintained pure nobility for the last 500+ years since the first king was crowned. Those of noble blood are the cultural elite. To not bow to a noble is a crime. The rich who are not nobles such as industrialists and merchants fight a silent war against the nobility with economics and political maneuvering. The noble class keeps the rich members of the kingdom happy while maintaining military control and flaunting it to put down the occasional uppity merchant who lets their ego get the better of them. This kingdom boasts its heavy calvary and elite soldiers, its main exports are food products and metal.  

        Essen Triumvirate: Assassins, snipers, and witch hunters.  

        Nestled in the valley of the Stranger. The Triumvirate is led by the three highest ranking members of the Dark Cloaks. The Dark Cloaks are not only the military and the government, but they are also the best spies in the land. Entrance into their valley is rare and they only let you into certain parts of their cities. These militant police state has done everything it can to maintain a fearsome reputation. Their main exports are selling the services of Dark Cloaks which entails mercenary work, assassins, and investigators, the extremely rare mithril of the World Wall, and lumber. 

        Loth-cor Theocracy: Clerics, paladins, and priests 

        This kingdom takes pride in the worship of the Heralds and the Great creators. This kingdom avidly sends missionaries to preach to the other kingdoms. The government structure is a council of 101 high priests. Iron hands are the loose military of  Loth’cor and are known as renowned heroes and warriors. Membership speaks volumes of an individual's character and moral fiber making them trusted bodyguards with the underlining understanding that their loyalty is to the theocracy first and can must respond to a summons when the horns of war are sounded. Some say that the greatest of the priests and warriors of the Creators have been able to perform great miracles, such as healing the sick, accurately seeing the future, and most notably in recent history the high priest is rumored to have summoned a heavenly blade of fire to strike down an assassin. Notable exports are medicines, textiles, and the Iron Hand directly competes with the Dark Cloak mercenaries. 
       <br>
        Heralds 

        The heralds are the warriors of creation and serve the Cycle of creation. Painfully perfect these warriors spare none who are corrupt or those who would rebel against the creation cycle. 

        Firstborn: The strongest of the Heralds, wielding the powers of creation and the greatest magical weapons ever forged. 

        Herald of oblivion: Wielders of the void, these Heralds are the lords of destruction and unmaking. They do what they must to scrub a world clean, feared even by their brothers they descend on worlds, and worlds are eradicated.  

        Herald of the Dark: These heralds walk the paths of night none may hide from these bringers of death. Putting both the living and the dead to the sword. 

        Herald of disaster: The anger of these warriors shakes the earth and breaks down the earth preparing it for reshaping. 

        Chosen Hunter: Foot soldiers of the heralds 

        Chosen Slayer: hunters and scouts of the heralds. 
        <br>

        World eaters 

        Children of the void. Oddly durable despite frail weak forms. World eaters reshape, warp, and consume all forms of matter and magic.  
        <br>
        Shadow Legion 

        These legionnaire ghosts walk between the realm of the dead and the living.

      Alternating Activations 

In an alternate activation system, The Opposition and the Party take turns activating individual Characters or Squads under their control. 
<br>
For example: 

Initial Party activates a Character or Squad (moves, shoots, uses abilities, charges, or fights). 

The Secondary Party then activates one of their Characters or Squads. 

This back-and-forth continues until all Entities have acted. 

Initial Activation is determined by a Parties total initiative score. 

If a Party has an Initiative score that is ten or more than the other Party an ambush is initiated.  

The Party that initiates an ambush may activate every character or Squad they control before the other Party may activate an Entity. Once the ambush is completed, you will determine initial activations as normal.  

How a Turn functions 

During an encounter an Entity has the following actions they can take in a turn in any order.  
<br>
Movement 
<br>
Action 
<br>
Minor action 
<br>
Movement can be spent to grant a Character a minor action, an action can be turned into a minor action, if you spend your minor action and movement, you may take a second action (All rolls made during a second action taken during a turn are made with a –1)  
<br>
Attacking 

When attacking the target of your attack makes a number of dodge rolls equal to your weapon’s attack value. This determines how many attacks you get to make against the target's armor. Each roll beating the opponent's armor deals damage 
<br>
Entity Types 

Every Entity has a type that determines how it will interact with the Character during an encounter.  
<br>
Allied NPCs 

Allies are NPCs friendly to the Character. Allied NPCs are controlled by the Character during an encounter. 

Artillery 

Artillery Entities represent mass arrow barrages, catapults, meteor, etc. Artillery Entities have long range, area effects, and deal a lot of damage. They are typically physically weak and easy to take down once proximity is reached. Artillery do not typically have high movement speed and rely on distance as their defense. 
<br>
Battlefield Controller 

A battlefield controller is an Entity that controls the environment of an encounter. Battlefield controllers will hamper opponents' movement, line of sight, and abilities. This type of Entity typically is physically weak, relying on their abilities, and allies to fight opponents and defend them. Overall battlefield controllers have low damage and are supportive in an encounter.  
<br>
Soldier 

This type of Entity is very average on all fronts. This type of Entity is typically part of a frontline protecting the supportive Entities in the rear. Typically, more defensive than anything else this Entity can put up a fight against PC’s. 
<br>
Skirmisher 

Skirmishers rely on speed and dodge rolls. Rushing across the battlefield, these entities will hit and run repeatedly until they defeat their opponent. Typically, Skirmishers are armed with ranged weapons or attacking multiple targets in quick succession 
<br>
Underling 

Underlings are nothing more than chaff to get in the way of PCs, but PCs beware, large numbers of Underlings have spelled the doom of many an adventurer. Underlings do not have health; instead, they die the moment they would take damage. 
<br>
Vanguard 

The vanguard is the center piece of any Opposition force. Dealing massive amounts of damage and having a monstrous health pool the vanguard is a terrifying and brutal force for PCs to deal with 
<br>
Warlord 

Warlords command Opposition forces, grant allies' great boons, and allow for Opposition forces to act during the warlord’s activation. 
<br>
Hero/Villan 

Heroes and Villans are NPCs that increase their skills like PCs. These NPCs are meant to interact with the party multiple times throughout a story. Heroes are Allied NPCs that Increase their skills exactly how players increase their skills. Villans are a little more complicated.
